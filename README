This is a project written with Python using the Pygame library by Griffin Lynch, begun during the Quarantine of 2020.

It is an Editor/Player bundle that allows (fairly) close(ish) recreations of levels from Super Mario Bros on the NES,
and is currently under development. It is merely something for me to work on to learn the ins and outs of Pygame
and game programming at large - I have no large ambitions for the project beyond reaching a certain level of accomplishment
(playability of all main mechanics) and some distribution among my friends (at no cost). 

Anyway, to use either the editor or the player, I recommend using the most recent versions of Python and Pygame. At the time of this
 writing, the Pygame website is not online, but Python is at v3.8.1. If you're having compatibility issues, maybe try to find a version
 closer to that.
 
Thanks for checking out my project! Have fun!
