To use the tool, go into the file 'LuigiLevelBuilder.py' and
set the file name you want to edit (all the levels are kept in 
the Levels folder)

So for example, if you want to edit the level 'test.txt', edit the 
'LuigiLevelBuilder.py' file, changing the line that says

filename = 'world1-1.txt'
to 
filename = 'test.txt'

If you want to make a new level, just plug in a new name, it'll handle
the file creation for you. Below are the controls for the editor:

Moving the cursor: arrow keys
Move the camera left: a 
Move the camera right: d
Delete a tile: Backspace
Change tiles: q
Move the other way in the tile list: e 
Stamp a tile: Space
Save the level and exit: l 
Exit without saving: click the x
